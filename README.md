# Susan-LeetCode-Journal
This repository serves as my daily LeetCode practice journal. It focuses on clean code and quick notes that capture key ideas and pitfalls. Beyond just solutions, it acts as a personal log of problem-solving progress and reflections, documenting both technical growth and learning patterns over time!
